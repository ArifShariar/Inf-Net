Figure 3. Example of COVID-19 infected regions in CT axial slice, where the red and green masks denote the ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation,
respectively. The images are collected from [1].

# COVID-SemiSeg Dataset
We also build a semi-supervised COVID-19 infection segmentation (COVID-SemiSeg) dataset, with 100 labeled CT scans from the COVID-19 CT Segmentation dataset [1] and 1600 unlabeled images from the COVID-19 CT Collection dataset [2]. <br>

## Training set
1. Lung infection which consists of 50 labels by doctors (Doctor-label) and 1600 pesudo labels generated (Pesudo-label) by our Semi-Inf-Net model.<br>
